## Project Overview

In this project, I have developed a web application to identify vehicle types using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The main tools and techniques utilized in this project include TensorFlow, Keras, Python, Flask, CSS, and HTML.

## Project Details

- **Dataset:** I have used a secondary dataset to train the model.
- **CNN Model:** The VGG16 model has been employed for this task.
- **Training:** The model was trained for up to 100 epochs. However, I implemented an early stopping callback to halt training early based on the validation loss to prevent overfitting. My training accuracy is 94%.
- **Model Size:** Due to the large size of the trained model (196 MB), it is not included in this repository.

## Tools and Technologies

- **TensorFlow**
- **Keras**
- **Python**
- **Flask**
- **CSS**
- **HTML**
